# CustomerMgmt
CustomerMgmt is a simple customer management android application developed and abandoned in 2016.

Its aim is to support customer management in a mobile and laptop repair store with the following requirements:
* Store customer and device data.
* Search specific customer or case.
* Track current repair cases.
* Notify customer for a closed case.

Originally designed to use the local SQLite database, but can be easily updated to use an external database.
